# Swift — Control Flow

## Objectives

## Control Flow

In the context of programming, [Control Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) refers to the group of code structures that allow decision-making to be defined, effectively allowing a developer to express a logic tree in code. A good metaphor for visualizing control flow is to imagine the branching tracks in a train-yard. Different control flow statements are analogous to different structures in the train tracks.

This reading will discuss the usage of the code structures detailed in the [Control Flow chapter](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-ID120) of Apple's *The Swift Programming Language*.
